# D365ActivityMigration
When importing or migrating data to a Dynamics 365 / CRM environment you cannot migrate the fields Created By, Modified By and Modified On. Most customers won’t bother about it until it comes down to the migration of ‘old’ activities. By default, the Social Panes show activities sorted on the Modified On date. So when you migrate data and all activities have ‘today’ as the Modified On date, you’ll get problems with the sorting of activities. https://www.dynamics365blog.nl/2017/05/08/migrating-importing-data-and-maintaining-created-by-modified-by-and-modified-on/
